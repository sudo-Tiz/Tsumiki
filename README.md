A semi-customizable bar written using the [Fabric Widget System](https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric)
The panel focuses on providing an all-in-one, fully integrated panel experience, where users don’t have to rely on separate, theme-less third-party tools to manage niche functions like buetooth, notifications,on screen display.

## **Installation**

### Required

Most of these are already installed on existing working machines

```sh
# network
networkmanager

pipewire


## Bluetooth menu utilities
gnome-bluetooth-3.0 # aur
bluez
bluez-utils

## Copy/Paste utilities
wl-clipboard

## Compiler for sass/scss
dart-sass

## Brightness module for OSD
brightnessctl
```

### Optional

```sh

## To check for pacman updates in the default script used in the updates module
pacman-contrib

## To switch between power profiles in the battery module
power-profiles-daemon

## To record screen through the dashboard record shortcut
wf-recorder

## To enable the eyedropper color picker with the default snapshot shortcut in the dashboard
hyprpicker

## To enable hyprland's very own blue light filter
hyprsunset

## To enable hyprland's very own idle inhibitor
hypridle

```

- Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rubiin/HyDePanel.git bar
cd bar
```

- Run the following command to install the required packages for particular os, few of them are already installed if you have a working system:

## Installation

You can choose one of two installation methods: **Automated Setup** or **Manual Setup**.

### Option 1: Automated Setup Using `init.sh -install`

1.  **Run the `init.sh -install` script** to automatically install all the required packages and dependencies (both `pacman` and AUR packages):

```sh
./init.sh -install
```

This script will:

- Install all required `pacman` and AUR packages.
- Set up the virtual environment and any required configurations.

1.  **Start the environment or bar** once the installation is complete:

```sh
./init.sh -start
```

This will launch the environment or bar as defined in your project.

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Install Dependencies First)

If you prefer to have more control over the installation process, you can install the required dependencies manually and then run the `init.sh -start` script.

#### Step 1: Install `pacman` Packages

Run the following command to install the required system packages:

```sh
	sudo pacman -S --noconfirm pipewire playerctl dart-sass power-profiles-daemon networkmanager wl-clipboard brightnessctl pkgconf wf-recorder kitty python pacman-contrib gtk3 cairo gtk-layer-shell libgirepository gobject-introspection gobject-introspection-runtime python-pip python-gobject python-psutil python-dbus python-cairo python-loguru python-setproctitle
```

#### Step 2: Install AUR Packages

Using `yay` to install the required AUR packages:

```sh
yay -S gray-git python-fabric gnome-bluetooth-3.0 python-rlottie-python
```

If you have something else besides `yay`, install with the respective aur helper.

#### Step 3: Run the `init.sh -start` Script

Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the bar or environment:

```sh
./init.sh -start
```

## **Usage**

Add this to your `.config/hyprland.conf`

```sh
exec = `$HOME/bar/init.sh -start`

```

### 1. **Cannot see system tray?**

Be sure to kill any bars that you may be running. You can kill other bar with `pkill bar-name`

### 2. **Cannot see notifications?**

Be sure to kill other notifications daemon that you may be running. You can kill other daeemons with `pkill dunst; pkill mako;`
